### Hello there!

I'm mainly interested in proc-gen now, check out my [roblox account](https://www.roblox.com/users/76163117/profile) which has some example work.

Contact me on Twitter [@shabbs15](https://twitter.com/iamshabbs15) or just follow me!

Or if you don't use twitter, here's my discord: [shabbs15#1592]()




I have quite a few repositoires. They mainly serve to [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) so lots of small programs. In order of usage:
